# Multiple Choice
## Thought Process
During lectures, we learned the following commands:
```
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
terraform destroy
```

Based on the possible answers

1. terraform import, terraform apply -y, terraform destroy
2. teraform init, terraform plan -auto-apply, terraform rm
3. terraform init, terraform run -auto-approve, terraform destroy
4. terraform init, terraform apply -auto-approve, terraform destroy
5. terraform import, terraform apply -y, terraform rm

1, and 5 contain and `import` command which I've not seen before. 2 contains `rm` which could but is not likely to replace `destroy`. 3 contains `run` which I've not seen. This leaves 4.

4 doesn't have a plan but has -auto-approve. This won't replace the plan but apply will go through the plan anyhow, the plan seemed more for the user's knowledge. When you use `terraform apply` it prompts you to approve/deny the command, this flag will probably sidestep this. 

This command was meant to solve the following:
> Which of the following sequences, respectively, describes the workflow for: 
 Downloading the provider plugins and setting up backend,
 Generating proposed changes and auto-executing the plan
 Remove all resources managed by terraform`
# Answer
4.

Terraform init downloads the plugs for the provider and setups up the backend. Apply and the approval flag will generate the changes and auto execute. Destroy will remove the IAAC created resource(s).
