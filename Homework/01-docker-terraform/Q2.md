# 1 . Answer without investigating
`db:5433`

```services:
  db:
    container_name: postgres
    image: postgres:17-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: 'postgres'
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: 'postgres'
      POSTGRES_DB: 'ny_taxi'
    ports:
      - '5433:5432'
    volumes:
      - vol-pgdata:/var/lib/postgresql/data

  pgadmin:
    container_name: pgadmin
    image: dpage/pgadmin4:latest
    environment:
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_EMAIL: "pgadmin@pgadmin.com"
      PGADMIN_DEFAULT_PASSWORD: "pgadmin"
    ports:
      - "8080:80"
    volumes:
      - vol-pgadmin_data:/var/lib/pgadmin

volumes:
  vol-pgdata:
    name: vol-pgdata
  vol-pgadmin_data:
    name: vol-pgadmin_data
```

# 2. Using docker compose and checking
- The container and service name are interchangeable when setting up a connection from another container, at least in the same network.
- We would only require to supply the host machines "local host" if we started the containers and they aren't in the same network. 
  - Local Host vs host.docker.internal:
    - When we're in the pgadmin container, to access the host machine and route to localhost:5433, we'd need it to recognise "localhost" as the hostmachine and not the container itself. We'd use host.docker.internal for this. Another route would be to obtain the container's IP adress and route through 5432. There's no guarantee of this IP being unique if we had loads of containers and networks. 

# 3. Final Answer
Given the following docker-compose.yaml, what is the hostname and port that pgadmin should use to connect to the postgres database?

~~postgres:5433~~ \
~~localhost:5432~~ \
~~db:5433~~\
**postgres:5432** \
**db:5432**
